        <h2>Generate algorithms from rules</h2>
        <p>
            The reduction rules generated by TermSAT have obvious patterns.
            For instance, once all the reduction rules were generated for all substitution instances of 
            formulas will three variables, it became obvious that all the rules could be replaced by 
            a rather simple algorithm that subsumes all the generated rules.

            So that begs a question... would it be possible to automatically generate an algorithm 
            from a set of reduction rules that subsumes all the staring rules?

            TermSAT is a machine for generating rules that can be used to reduce boolean formulas.
            Originallt TermSAT was an experiment to see if it was possible to generate a confluent set of
            reduction rules for the boolean formulas.
            While this is probably not possible, what is possible is that TermSAT could generate an ever
            increasingly powerful set of reduction rules that could be used to solve ever increasingly
            difficult problems.

            Once the rule set generated by TermSAT becomes powerful enough TermSAT could be offered as a commercial service.
