The TermSAT project is a collection of applications written for the purpose of discovering and enumerating a set of rewrite rules for reducing formulas in propositional logic.
The goal of the TermSAT project is to produce a complete and finite set of rule that can be shown to reduce propositional formula in polynomial time.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem.

It is assumed that the reader has already read sat.wiki and understands the theory behind the TermSAT reduction rules.  
This document provides a summary of the applications in the project and descriptions of how they work.


 * The database of basic reduction rules generated by this program is then 
 * used as input into the RuleIndexer program.  RuleIndexer creates a special 
 * index used by the RuleRepository class from the rule database.
 * The purpose of this index is to make it much more efficient to find 
 * reduction rules that apply to a given formula. 
 *
 * RuleCompletionGenerator program that generates a 
 * database of confluent rules from these basic rules.
