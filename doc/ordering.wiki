This document describes a method of ordering of formulas.
The purpose of this ordering is to provide a method of determining the 'complexity' of a formula.  
The ultimate purpose of such an ordering is to provide the basis for 
creating a confluent set of reduction rules for reducing proposition formulas.
Such an ordering is a necessary condition for for producing such a set of rules.

Formulas are represented in a textual form...
The normal form uses Polish notation and...
...the symbols 'T' and 'F' for TRUE and FALSE.
...the symbol '-' for the negation operator, followed by a formula. 
...the symbol '*' for the implication operator, followed by the consequent and then the antecedent. 
...a number greater than 0 followed by the symbol '.' for representing variables.

Some examples for formulas...
T
T
*1.T
*-1.3.
-*1.4.
***1.3.-*3.F4.

Here is the ordering...
...formulas that are shorter than a given formula are less complex than the formula. 
...formulas that are the same length are ordered lexically
