I'm a compter programmer and I'm fascinated with technologies that use rewriting, like template engines, parsers, scripting languages, and maybe automated reasoning.
This repository is a dump for my attempts to create an automated logic system based on rewriting.  
There are already logic systems based on rewriting, Existential Graphs (EG) is one of them.

For now, the only thing of interest to see here is this uncompleted proof.  
It's a non-constructive proof that expressions in system R, 
a system of propositional logic similar to EG, 
can be minimized in a polynomial # of steps.

I'm looking for feedback.  
I'm definitely not a genius, so it's not super complicated.  
Take a sec to look :-).  
Start here.
