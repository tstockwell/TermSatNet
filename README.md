## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This repository is under construction.  

I've convinced myself that I've built a rewrite system can minimize boolean expressions in polynomial time.  

To even get feedback from other people I'll need proof and code, so I'm working on that.  

I've made this repository public, and I'm currently building out the wiki and building a SAT solver.  

Take a look at the wiki if your interest is piqued.  
Feel free to leave a message in the discussion area.
